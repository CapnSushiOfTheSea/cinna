- complete rework of the help command
    - make it so arguments work anywhere, so long as it's at the end
    - make it so the help command shows info on specific commands if asked
        (e.g. "parcel get --help" or like "parcel remove --help")
- add more packages to repo
- get other people to contribute somehow
    - unnecessary but okay
